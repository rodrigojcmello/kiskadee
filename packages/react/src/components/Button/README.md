- Gradiant border is not supported (used in Fluent), however, neither the Web and Android versions use this feature, which should indicate equal understanding

Experience

- Focus - Focus - Design systems created for mobile devices usually don't care about this feature, in these cases instead of removing the focus, the native platform feature was left active
